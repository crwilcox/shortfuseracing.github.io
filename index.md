### Seppi Hutter

Seppi Hutter currently races a 2016 Yamaha R3 in WMRRA’s Ultralightweight
class.  His track riding / racing career began when he purchased a blue street
Triumph Daytona 675 from Team Co-Founder Paul McComsey and Paul asked him
“Have you ever been to a race track before?”  A dedicated track bike was bought
within months of that question and the addiction was started.

Seppi is also the avid bike builder. Seppi holds the team record for unique race classes entered, having built and entered upon two Triumph Daytona 675’s, a Kawasaki Ninja 250, and a Yamaha R3. Seppi is adding to this record by building a Suzuki SV 650 and plans to enter and race it before the end of the 2022 season.
